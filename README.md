# DevLynx.Packaging 
[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0-yellow.svg)](https://semver.org)

.NET Library designed to provide an optimal solution to the [Bin Packing Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem). This solution was developed solely for three-dimensional (3D) bin packing.

This libray includes an implementation of an algorithm developed by Erhan Baltacıoğlu as [a master's thesis project](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJOR.2006.009300) at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in 2001. A copy of that document has been included [in this repository.](./docs/Three%20Dimensional%20Pallet-Packing%20Problem%20A%20Human%20Intelligence-based%20Heuristic%20Approach.pdf)

The original source code was uploaded by [Bill Knechtel](https://github.com/wknechtel/3d-bin-pack), this library contains a .NET port with further improvements and updates using modern development practices.

## Goals: 
 - [x] Full port to .NET
 - [ ] Add More Unit Tests
 - [ ] Implement Visualizer (WPF, Blazor, .etc)
 - [ ] Create Nuget Package
