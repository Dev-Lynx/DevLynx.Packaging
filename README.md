# DevLynx.Packaging

.NET Library designed to provide an optimal solution to the [Bin Packing Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem). This solution was developed solely for three-dimensional (3D) bin packing.

This libray includes an implementation of an algorithm developed by Erhan BALTACIOGLU as [a master's thesis project](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJOR.2006.009300) at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in 2001. A copy of that document has been included [in this repository.](./docs/Three%20Dimensional%20Pallet-Packing%20Problem%20A%20Human%20Intelligence-based%20Heuristic%20Approach.pdf)


This project is the C# port of the source code provided by Bill Knechtel on [Github](https://github.com/wknechtel/3d-bin-pack). The code has been improved and updated using more mordern development practices.
